What did you change to fix the code?

A couple of things, in order of least severity, in my professional judgment:

1) Refactored the CostCalculator itself to decouple it from the Console like it was.

1a) This helps make it more testable under a variety of conditions.

1b) I can be tested using Console.In, Console.Out, a StringReader, and so on.

2) Permitted taxes to be determined by either state name or their abbreviations.

2a) Does so in a case insensitive manner.

3) Replaced the Address parsing with regular expressions.

3a) Not only was it hard to follow, but it was breaking down in the state names, zip codes, etc.

3b) Additionally, not all the known address use cases were being handled properly.

4) One other observation, the calculations involve integer math.

4a) Usually, commerce, or more broadly fiducial apps, involve at least Single or Double floating points math, if not especially Decimal, especially where precise accuracy is desired.

Did you see any bad coding practices in the original code?

See answer to #2 along these lines.

* Really, really strong coupling to Main and/or Console.
* Use of integer for fiducial calculations.
* Did not pay attention to clearly stated requirements, i.e. re: state names, abbreviations, etc.
